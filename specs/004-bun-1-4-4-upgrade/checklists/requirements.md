## Notes

- The product is a Bazel ruleset for Bun, so Bazel, Bun, CI job names and canary names are the
  domain vocabulary its users and stakeholders work in, not implementation choices; the spec names
  no file layout or code structure beyond the artifacts the user named.
- Open: FR-003 (keep or drop Bun 1.4.2 among the known versions).
